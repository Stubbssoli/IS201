                        <p>I love learning, and I want to continue to progress and learn beyond the years of a formal education. Currently, I am looking to apply to the HR program in the business school as I see a lot of opportunities there. This last summer I learned more about the business world and I loved connecting with the people I was privileged to meet. I am currently taking an HR class and I have started to become involved with faculty and students in the HR program, and I finally feel at home. I am thankful to have such a great education because it really has brightened my life and given me great opportunities that have changed how I see the world around me.
                            <p>
                        <p>When I returned home from my mission, I read a syllabus for one of my classes and noticed that we receive points for professionalism. I was astounded. The high expectations exceed far beyond achieving a letter “A” on a transcript, although undoubtedly it is important to strive for this. The environment at BYU is focused on helping students become lifelong learners. This goes beyond simply learning facts and information about the world around us; we are taught how to truly live and how we can have the power to shape the world around us. I feel incredibly blessed to have a professor that cared enough to take away class points for students who showed up late, or not at all. A teacher who cared enough to support us in our commitment to live the honor code. When it really comes down to it, this is what I aspire to achieve; to return with honor. To live in a way that reflects my inner commitment and clearly demonstrates that I know who I am. This last summer I was presented with an opportunity that has caused me to reflect on my academic and career goals. I had been searching for a summer job, and though presented with many wonderful opportunities, nothing felt right. One day, as I discussed this dilemma with my aunt and uncle, they offered me a position at their insurance agency as a sales representative. I immediately felt that this was where I needed to be. I made some lofty goals, and in the span of two weeks I had studied for close to 90 hours and received my insurance licenses for Property & Casualty, as well as for Life insurance. This summer job helped me see that I can do hard things, and helped me recognize that I know who I am and what matters most. My dreams aren’t quite concrete yet, because my experiences and people I meet change day by day.  But I do know that some of my goals include graduating from BYU with a set of skills that will help me excel in whatever career paths, church callings, and parenting opportunities I will have. Step by step, I am learning day by day.</p>
