                            Though I have participated in teaching internships, church callings, various work opportunities, and other leadership opportunities, my family circumstances have taught me the most about what it means to lead. One of the greatest parts of my life is being the oldest of six children. When I was younger, I found it difficult because I recognized my job to lead and guide my siblings. I thought I was missing out because my siblings would continue to live in the home, forming core memories while I was off experiencing the world. And some of those experiences gave a clear example of what they should do and not do. I recognized that each of my siblings would have the chance to choose incredible experiences and opportunities like those I have had. I wished I had an older sibling to watch and learn from. 

                            <p></p>Overtime, these longings eventually shifted and I’ve come to recognize how blessed I am to be the oldest child. My position didn’t change, but my perspective did. I am incredibly privileged that I get to be present for all the most important parts of my siblings lives. I get to be there for the first time they do baptisms in the temple when they’ve waited for years as their older siblings went time and time again. I get to see my siblings' faces when they are in the celestial room for the first time. I get to see them open their mission calls and think of how much their lives will change as they come to know who they really follow. The best leaders are followers. Jesus Christ always follows the will of the Father, and this is what I strive to do. On my mission I learned about leadership more than I ever thought possible. I learned what it looks like to stand up for what is right, despite mocking and persecution. I know what it looks like to say the truth even when it’s not always easier. I’ve learned that with high love comes high expectations. We can and should expect more in ourselves. We are given a voice that our thoughts may be shared. 
                            I get to be there for those special moments because I choose to follow the greatest leader. When others follow me, I want them to recognize that I am not the leader. 
                            I do have an older brother. His name is Jesus Christ and my life is happier following Him. He is the leader.
